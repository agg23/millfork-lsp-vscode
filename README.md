# Millfork VSCode Extension

Adds support for the [Millfork](https://github.com/KarolS/millfork) language server for VSCode. Extension is still in progress, but should be sufficent for regular use. At the moment, I recommend also using https://github.com/Ambez05/mcx16vscodeext for syntax highlighting.

## Configuration

| Option | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| `millfork.jarPath` | The path of the Millfork jar file. If relative, path is based on the current workspace |
